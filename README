Appcelerator Titanium iPhone Module Project
===========================================

This is a skeleton Titanium Mobile iPhone module project.  Modules can be 
used to extend the functionality of Titanium by providing additional native
code that is compiled into your application at build time and can expose certain
APIs into JavaScript. 

INSTALL YOUR MODULE
--------------------

1. Run `build.py` which creates your distribution
2. cd to `/Library/Application Support/Titanium`
3. copy this zip file into the folder of your Titanium SDK

REGISTER YOUR MODULE
---------------------

Register your module with your application by editing `tiapp.xml` and adding your module.
Example:

<modules>
	<module version="0.1">com.hflip</module>
</modules>

When you run your project, the compiler will know automatically compile in your module
dependencies and copy appropriate image assets into the application.

USING THE MODULE IN CODE
------------------------

To use your module in code, you will need to require it. 

For example,

	var my_module = require('com.hflip');
	my_module.foo();




Cheers!
